# Installing Gibbon


## Download Gibbon

Visit [Gibbon Download page](https://gibbonedu.org/download/) to download the Gibbon Core.


## Manual Installation

After download and unzipping:

1.  Copy all files to your server, choosing either the root directory or a sub-folder within it.
2.  Navigate your browser to the folder on your server where Gibbon has been located.
3.  Follow the on-screen instructions in Gibbon's new installer.
4.  Check out the [Getting Started With Gibbon](<../getting-started/next-steps.md>) page for more information.

_Note: If you want to help test and develop Gibbon, you can select the [Cutting Edge Code](cutting-edge-code.md) option in the installer. This allows you to run the latest code from [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/core). This is not recommended for production environments._

The video below gives an overview of the installation process:
