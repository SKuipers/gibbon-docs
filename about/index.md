### Open Source!

All of our docs are open source, written and maintained by members of the Gibbon community. 

If you'd like to contribute to the Gibbon docs, you could:

- ###### Edit a Page
  Look for the __{{<icon fa-code-fork >}} Edit Page__ link in the top right corner of each page. If you spot a typo or would like to help update the docs, feel free to [edit the page](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/). Each page has a part at the top inside `---`s called front-matter, which contains extra details about the page, and the area below that is the page's body content.

- ###### Create a New Page
  An "expand the docs" link can be found at the bottom of each main section page. Type the name of your new content, then click the `New Page` button.

- ###### Create a New Section
  New sections can be added in much the same way as new pages (above). The filename should always be `_index.md`, but you can add a title to the section's front-matter and add descriptive content below that.

- ###### Submit an Issue
  Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/docs/issues) through GitHub if you spot anything that can't be fixed with the options above.

Any time you edit or create a page you'll be submitting a GitHub [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to notify us of your changes. Once submitted, please allow some time for us to review your PR and merge them into the docs. 

### Written in Markdown

The docs are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a simple plain-text format that can be authored with any text editor, a number of [online](https://dillinger.io/) [tools](http://www.ctrlshift.net/project/markdowneditor/), or directly in the GitHub editor. You can learn more about the Markdown syntax with a quick [online guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

### Built with Hugo

This documentation site is built with the awesome open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is based on [DocDock](https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-docdock), a fork of the [Learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) theme, and has been customized for Gibbon.

### Deploys with Netlify

Each time a change is made to the [Gibbon Docs repository](https://github.com/GibbonEdu/docs/) on GitHub the whole site is automatically generated and deployed via the amazing JAM-stack wizardry of [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
